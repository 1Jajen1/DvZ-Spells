DvZ-Spells
==========
To-Do:

- General weird stuff
  - Make a way to get random Bruce, random amount of other hearoe's and for them random players (not bruce or another hereo!)
  - Find some way of making server time based spells for progression
  - Permissions (The most annoying part ever)
  - Find a solution to grant spells and have them learned by the players without a reload! Spells need a reload if they are granted with permissions. Yes nisovins code is weird)
  - That's basiclly it. Last 3 points are most important, everything else is not really hard to do.
    But permissions are a pain to work with because most of the time u do stuff right but they still never work. Permissions are weird!
  - Missed one important thing: Decide which permission plugin to use. Niso's is crap but its probably the only one that works completly with magicspells.

- Complete game progression and start is missing.
  - Make a start (Teleporting players, setting time, changing names etc)
  - Progression
    - Monster release
      - Plague
      - changing names, classes and all that
      - Setting up new mob spawn point
      - kill every player after that on joining the server
      - add every dead player to mob permission class
    - Special Mob spawning
  - Mob shrine draining
    - Shrine fall and game end
  - at last 24/7 progression means a way to start end and reset games
  
- Setting up Mob part
  - Permissions
  - Spell for skeletons for wither
  - Creeper explosion (It has to be worldedit based, because a normal explosion can't do what is needed)
  - Special Monsters
    - Golem effects
    - Adding Special Mobs in general (One become spell and a spell for items)
    
- Setting up dwarf part
  - Permissions for Dwarves
  - Fix Bowl and Mortar making. (Weird id and data value issue)
  - Procs and all that is based on pmc dvz, if u want gym then rollback to shorter proc
  
- Setting up pre-game part
  - permission setup
  - lobby teleport
  - effects for in lobby
  
- Hereo part
  - Adding all Hereo's
  - Special Items and Abilities for Heroes
    - Deadbones slabs
    - Kedemonias Heal and grab item
    - Nisovins bow and wrench
    - Stuff that i forgot
