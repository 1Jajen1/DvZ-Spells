# Magicspells config file (Not at all ready for DvZ) Also used for a general To-Do list:

# General To-Do list for everything: Remove any notifications players are getting. (World edit will not be used after i updated 
# Magicspells. So no need to remove their messages). Any tab-completion on commands should be removed (Which is probably already
# done by only giving them /msg commands. No other commands should be allowed by players. Set up all the config files. Essentials
# and this one still have to be finished, same with Disguisecraft, spigot's config file (Spigot is an advanced and better version
# of bukkit, got 1.6 world edit working with that!). If anyone knows a way to read out website stuff and enter things in the console
# from a diffrent program we could probably get Titles working.

# General important !IMPORTANT! information:
# Note changes every time u change stuff. Get git-hub or make a changes file because that helps a lot. Also add a lot of documentation text
# because it helps understanding.
